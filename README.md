# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

Steve wants to analyze more research for his parents which is to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. He would like us to refactor the original code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information. Also, he wants us making the code more efficient-by taking fewer steps and making the VBA script run faster.
