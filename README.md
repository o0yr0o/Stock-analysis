# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

Steve wants to analyze more research for his parents which is to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. He would like us to refactor the original code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information. Also, he wants us making the code more efficient-by taking fewer steps and making the VBA script run faster.

## Results

### Stock Performance
Since Steve wants to analyze the entire stock market in the past few years for his parents, we can use this graph to visualize and make him and his parents have a better understanding of the stock market in 2017 and 2018 .

The total daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day, so the total daily volume for one year can provide a rough idea of how actively stocks was traded in 2017 and 2018. The yearly return is the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. In other words, it is how much your investment grew by the end of the year.

According to the graph, although DQ's yearly return in 2017 was very high, it fell to the lowest return in the entire stock market in 2018. DQ's total daily volume is also low, despite the 2018 trading volume has increased, but still far less than other stocks. So I would not recommended this stock to Steve's parents.

The yearly return of the entire stock market has declined in 2018, but only RUN and ENPH have increased. The annual return of RUN increased from 5.5% to 84%, and the daily trading volume in 2018 also increased, indicating that the stock has a continuing upward trend. ENPH, on the other hand, had a positive return in 2018, but its annual return fell from 129.5% in 2017 to 81.9% in 2018. And his daily transaction volume has grown rapidly from 2017 to 2018. This suggests that the stock also has a tendency to rise, but once future daily trading volume drops, its annual return is likely to fall even faster. Therefore, comparing the two stocks, I would recommend Steve's parents to invest in Run, but if his parents can tolerate higher risks, ENPH can also consider investing.
